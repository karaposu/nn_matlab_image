# nn_matlab_image
matlab 2017 is used for this project

this code train a nn which recognizes the images as a vertical or horizantal ..  it took a sample image . then calculate row means and column means then downsample this 100 values to 50 values.  after that code put these downsampled values One under the other.  so for one image we have 50x1 matrix. for 30 picture data we have 50x30 data. 

what you need to test it?

You need to create 30  images from paint.  15 of them is for vertical lines 15 of them for horizantal lines. with format of .bmp
And resize them to 50x50. then you need to type your folder directory to the code. which is easy once you read it .


have fun ...
